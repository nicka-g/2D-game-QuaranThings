** ABOUT THE GAME **

This is a 2D mini quiz game entitled "QuaranThings", created with Unity, using C# language. It was developed for the completion of a school project.

The questions are based on all the important things and events that happened during the pandemic's lockdown period, where everyone had to be quarantined and practice social distancing. So, expect questions about COVID-19, Sports, Entertainment, and even all the trends and topics that went viral in the Philippines and around the world during that time.

** Game Mechanics **

1. The game has three levels that players need to complete consecutively. Like a typical quiz game, each question has multiple choices. If the player selects a correct answer, it will turn "green". Otherwise, it will turn "red".
2. In each level, the player is allowed only three mistakes, represented by a "red heart". When the player makes a mistake, they will lose a heart.
3. Players must answer the quiz within a few seconds. If time runs out before they finish answering all the necessary questions, the game will be over. However, they can still retry it.
4. As the levels progress, the number of questions will increase, as well as the time allotted.

** NOTES **
- There are checkpoints in each level, so players will be able to save their progress and won't have to restart the whole quiz from the beginning.
- The theme of the game is pixel and pastel.
